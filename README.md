# OpenXTalk macOS Native App Tools

This is a Builder (.lcb) library extension that uses the
Builder Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to wrap a few features
of Apple Cocoa API's AppKit, thereby making them accessible to 
Stacks and Scripts.

The goal is to make this library as useful as possible 
for making built standalone macOS apps appear 
and behave as normal native mac apps could (or should).

Feel free to modify, branch, or include any part of it in your
own Builder projects. If you do so you must publish your source .lcb
in accordance to GPL3 so others can learn from it.
