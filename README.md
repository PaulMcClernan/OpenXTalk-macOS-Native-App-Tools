# OpenXTalk macOS Native App Tools

This is a OpenXTalk Builder library extension that uses the
Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to wrap some of the features
of Apple Cocoa API's AppKit, thereby making them accessible to 
xTalk Scripts.

The goal is to make this library is to be as useful as possible 
for making built standalone macOS apps appear and behave as 
normal native mac apps could (or should).

Feel free to modify, branch, or include any part of it in your
own Builder projects. If you do so you must publish your source .lcb
in accordance to GPLv3 license so that others can learn from it.
