# LiveCode-LCB-macOSTools

This is a LiveCode Builder (.lcb) library extension that uses
LCB's Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to wrap a few features
of Apple Cocoa API's AppKit, thereby making them accessible to 
LiveCode Stacks and Scripts.

The goal is to make this library as useful as possible 
for making LC built standalone macOS apps appear 
and behave as normal native mac apps could (or should).

Feel free to modify, branch, or include any part of it in your
own LiveCode Builder projects, all I ask is that if you do so
you publish your source .lcb so others can learn from it.
